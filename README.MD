## Description:
Our project is a job board web application that will cater specifically to the aviation industry. This site allows for two different types of users to
perform certain actions/tasks depending on whether they are a "jobseeker" a person looking for a job, or a "company_owner" a person who own an a business
in the aviation industry. We hope our project will enhance itself as its scales in size with the more users that are on our site adding to the job searching 
and job posting experience
