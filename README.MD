## Description:
Our project is a job board web application that will cater specifically to the aviation industry. This site allows for two different types of users to
perform certain actions/tasks depending on whether they are a "jobseeker" a person looking for a job, or a "company_owner" a person who own an a business
in the aviation industry. We hope our project will enhance itself as its scales in size with the more users that are on our site adding to the job searching 
and job posting experience.
<br>
<br>
When a user first access our site he is an unauthorized user that can only view the home page and see the features that are available such as searching for jobs
or searching for candidates. If the unauthorized user would like to access these features he first must decide what type of user he wants to belong to a "jobseeker"
or a "company_owner". A jobseeker is recommended for those who want to search and apply for jobs, while a company_owner is for those business owning individuals who
want to post jobs. Jobseekers have the option to register for a new user or log in with their LinkedIn credentials and transfer their name, username, password, and
profile picture from their LinkedIn page. Once a user has been registered they're able to login and have their selected profile page and interface customized to
them and the user group (jobseeker or company_owner) they belong to.
